The directory that contains the data to be ingested (identified by the `input_dir` config option) needs to contain a CSV file with field content and any accompanying media files you want to add to the newly created nodes:

```
your_folder/
├── image1.JPG
├── pic_saturday.jpg
├── image-27262.jpg
├── IMG_2958.JPG
├── someimage.jpg
└── metadata.csv
```

The names of the image/PDF/video/etc. files can take any form you want since they are included in the `file` column of the CSV file. Files of any extension are allowed.

By defualt, if the `file` value for a row is empty, Workbench's `--check` option will show an error. But, in some cases you may want to create a node but not add any media. If you add `allow_missing_files: true` to your config file for "create" tasks, you can leave the `file` cell in your CSV for that item empty.
