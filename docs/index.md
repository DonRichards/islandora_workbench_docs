## Overview

A command-line tool that allows creation, updating, and deletion of Islandora content from CSV data. Islandora Workbench is an alternative to using Drupal's built-in Migrate tools for [ingesting Islandora content from CSV files](https://github.com/Islandora/migrate_islandora_csv). Unlike the Migrate tools, Islandora Workbench can be run anywhere - it does not need to run on the Islandora server. Migrate, however, is much more flexible than Islandora Workbench, and can be extended using plugins in ways that Workbench cannot.

A companion project under development, [Islandora Workbench Desktop](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench_desktop), will add a graphical user interface that enables users not familiar or comfortable with the command line to use Workbench.

This tool is not related in any way to the Drupal contrib module called [Workbench](https://www.drupal.org/project/workbench).

## Usage

`./workbench --config config.yml --check`

then

`./workbench --config config.yml`
