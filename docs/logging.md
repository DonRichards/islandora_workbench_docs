Islandora Workbench writes a log file for all tasks to `workbench.log` in the workbench directory, unless you specify an alternative log file location using the `log_file_path` configuration option, e.g.:

`log_file_path: /tmp/mylogfilepath.log`

 By default, new entries are appended to this log, unless you indicate that the log file should be overwritten each time Workbench is run by providing the `log_file_mode` configuration option with a value of "w":

 `log_file_mode: w`
