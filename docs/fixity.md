Islandora Workbench supports transmission fixity auditing, which means it can ensure that files are ingested intact, without corruption. It does this by generating a checksum (a.k.a. "hash") for each file before it is ingested, and then after it is ingested, it asks Drupal for a checksum on the file using the same hash algorithm. If the two checksums are identical, you can be assured that the file was not corrupted during the ingest process.

To enable this feature, include the `fixity_algorithm` option in your configuation file, specifying one of "md5", "sha1", or "sha256" hash algorithms. For example, to use the "md5" algorithm, include the following in your config file:

```yaml
fixity_algorithm: md5
```

If you want Workbench to compare the hash it generates for a file to a known hash value (for example, one generated by a platform you are migrating from), include a "checksum" column in your CSV file for "create" tasks. If that column is present, Workbench will compare the hash it generates with the value in that column and report matches and mismatches. Note that the checksum in your CSV must have been generated using the same algorithm specified in your configuration file.

Workbench will log all successful checksum comparisions, and will also log all mismatches. However, even if there is a mismatch, Workbench will continue to ingest the file and create the accompanying media.

!!! note
    Asking Islandora Workbench to perform transmission fixity auditing slows it down to a certain extent. This is normal.
