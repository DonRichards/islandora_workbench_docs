## Transmission fixity

Islandora Workbench supports transmission fixity auditing, which means it can ensure that files are ingested intact, without corruption. It does this by generating a checksum (a.k.a. "hash") for each file before it is ingested, and then after the file is ingested, Workbench asks Drupal for a checksum on the file using the same hash algorithm. If the two checksums are identical, you can be assured that the file was not corrupted during the ingest process.

This functionality is available within `create` and `add_media` tasks. Only files named in the `file` CSV column are checked.

To enable this feature, include the `fixity_algorithm` option in your `create` or `add_media` configuation file, specifying one of "md5", "sha1", or "sha256" hash algorithms. For example, to use the "md5" algorithm, include the following in your config file:

```yaml
fixity_algorithm: md5
```

If you want Workbench to compare the hash it generates for a file to a known hash value (for example, one generated by a platform you are migrating from), include a `checksum` column in your CSV file for `create` tasks. If that column is present, Workbench will compare the hash it generates with the value in that column and report matches and mismatches. Note that the checksum in your CSV must have been generated using the same algorithm specified in your configuration file.

## Validating checksums during --check

If you have pregenerated checksum values for your files, you can ask Workbench to compare those checksums with checksums during its `--check` phase. To do this, include the following options in your `create` or `add_media` configuration file:

```yaml
fixity_algorithm: md5
validate_fixity_during_check: true
```

This requires both a `file` and `checksum` column in your input CSV, and that the checksums in the CSV column use the algorithm named in the `fixity_algorithm` setting. Results of the checks are written to the log file.

Some things to note:

* Workbench will log all successful checksum comparisions, and will also log all mismatches. However, even if there is a mismatch, Workbench will continue to ingest the file and create the accompanying media.
* Fixity checking slows Workbench down to a certain extent. This is normal.
