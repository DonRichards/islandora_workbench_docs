In some instances, you may want to create stub nodes that only have a small subset of fields, and then populate the remaining fields later. To faciliate this type of workflow, Workbench provides an option to generate a simple CSV file containig a record for every newly created node. This file can then be used later in `update` tasks to add additional metadata or in `add_media` tasks to add media.

 You tell Workbench to generate this file by including the optional `output_csv` setting in your configuration file. If this setting is present, Workbench will write a CSV file at the specified location containing one record per node created. This CSV file contains the following fields:

 * `id` (or whatever column is specified in your `id_field` setting): the value in your input CSV file's ID field
 * `node_id`: the node ID for the newly created node
 * `uuid`: the new node's UUID
 * `status`: true if the node is published, False if it is unpublished
 * `title`: the node's title

 The file will also contain empty columns corresponding to all of the fields in the target content type. An example, generated from a 2-record input CSV file, looks like this (only left-most part of the spreadsheet shown):

This CSV file is suitable as a template for subsequent `update` tasks, since it already contains the `node_id`s for all the stub nodes plus column headers for all of the fields in those nodes. You can remove from the template any colums you do not want to include in your `update` task. You can also use the node IDs in this file as the basis for later `add_media` tasks; all you will need to do is delete the other columns and add a `file` column containing the new nodes' corresponding filenames.
